<H1>How to download a user filled submission form from VAMPS</H1>
<ol>
<li>
Have the user create a submisson on VAMPS (<a href="http://vamps.mbl.edu/utils/submissions/project_submit.php" target="_blank">Project Submission</a>).
</li>

<li>
After you log into <a href="http://vamps.mbl.edu" target="_blank">VAMPS</a>, 
click on the link 
"<a href="http://vampsdev.mbl.edu/utils/submissions/admin_submission.php" target="_blank">CSV File Download/Upload</a>".
<p/>
(If you go from VAMPS it will be on the 
"<a href="http://vamps.mbl.edu/utils/submissions/admin_submission.php" target="_blank">Project Submission-ADMIN</a>" page.)

</li>

<li>
Select the submission you want, e.g. <em>sgrim123456</em>, then click "go" and then "Download csv". 
<p/>
That will download the CSV file to your local machine.
</li>

<li>
Modify the downloaded CSV, 
save as a UNIX csv (Microsoft does not do this by default -- you may have to open the csv in TextWrangler and save as a UNIX csv).
</li>

<li>
Then you can upload the csv <a href="http://vampsdev.mbl.edu/illumina_submission/step_upload_subm_metadata.php">here</a> below to use it for Illumina processing.
</li>
</ol>
